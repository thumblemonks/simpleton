      Simpleton takes a simple, object-oriented approach to the way
      you deploy your server applications.
      
      With Simpleton, you express (and test) the things that need to
      happen during a deployment as Middleware objects. A Command Runner
      runs the command from a Middleware on a remote host, and
      Simpleton orchestrates the operation of Command Runners on the
      hosts you've configured.
      
      Simpleton ships with a few common Middleware, a couple of Command
      Runners, and makes it very easy to roll your own. Enjoy!
